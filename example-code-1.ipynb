    "#### 📌 Notebook Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to perform fast, resource-efficient fine-tuning of the Mistral-7B model on a MacBook using Apple’s MLX framework with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). The goal is to explore a lightweight fine-tuning workflow that produces tangible artifacts such as converted model files, LoRA adapter checkpoints (adapters.npz), and training logs. These artifacts are central to the thesis focus on deduplication-aware computation reuse, since repeated fine-tuning runs naturally generate redundant files. By setting up baseline inference, applying LoRA fine-tuning, and then testing inference again with the trained adapters, we gain hands-on understanding of how modern LLM fine-tuning works on consumer hardware. This workflow is not only useful for quickly experimenting with LLM behavior changes on a MacBook, but also provides the foundation for tracking, analyzing, and optimizing redundant computations in larger Kubernetes-based ML pipelines later in the thesis."

    "#### 🔑 Key Components in This Notebook\n",
    "1. **MLX Framework (mlx_lm)**\n",
    "* Apple’s library for running and fine-tuning large language models on MacBooks with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3).\n",
    "* Provides efficient inference and LoRA fine-tuning using Metal GPU backend (instead of CPU).\n",
    "* Why important: Lets you experiment quickly on your Mac without needing expensive NVIDIA GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mistral-7B Model**\n",
    "* A modern large language model (LLM) with ~7 billion parameters.\n",
    "* Pretrained on massive text corpora and instruction-tuned (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2).\n",
    "* Why important: Serves as the base model we fine-tune — showing how LLMs can be adapted to custom tasks or personas (e.g., “ShawGPT”).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Conversion (convert.py)**\n",
    "* Converts a Hugging Face model (PyTorch weights) into MLX format. Models like Mistral-7B are usually released on Hugging Face Hub in PyTorch format (.bin weight files, often >10–20 GB). Apple’s MLX framework doesn’t read PyTorch weights directly. So convert.py translates those weights into a format MLX understands → .npz files (NumPy arrays stored efficiently).\n",
    "* By default, models store weights in 16-bit or 32-bit precision (FP16 / FP32). Quantization reduces that to 4-bit integers (int4).\n",
    "    * **Example:**\n",
    "        * **Original weight:** 0.123456 (FP32, ~32 bits)\n",
    "        * **Quantized weight:** 0.12 (INT4, ~4 bits)\n",
    "        * This shrinks the file size and speeds up computation — at the cost of a tiny bit of accuracy.\n",
    "* With `-q` flag, it also quantizes the model (reduces precision to 4-bit).\n",
    "* Why important: Quantization makes the model smaller and faster → critical for running Mistral on a MacBook.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Fine-Tuning (lora.py)**\n",
    "* What is LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)?\n",
    "* Big models like Mistral-7B have billions of parameters.\n",
    "* Normally, fine-tuning means updating all those parameters → which needs huge GPU memory (like your lab’s H100s).\n",
    "* LoRA is a clever trick:\n",
    "    * Instead of changing the original weights, it inserts small trainable adapter layers into certain parts of the model (e.g., attention layers).\n",
    "    * During fine-tuning, only these adapters are updated.\n",
    "    * The original big model stays frozen.\n",
    "* A method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.\n",
    "* Instead of updating all billions of parameters, it trains only small adapter layers (adapters.npz).\n",
    "* Why important: Much faster and feasible on Mac hardware. Produces small artifacts that are perfect for your deduplication experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prompt Builder**\n",
    "* Wraps user input in an instruction-tuned prompt format ([INST] ... [/INST]).\n",
    "* Guides the LLM to behave like “ShawGPT” (your role-playing assistant).\n",
    "* Why important: Lets you control model behavior consistently before and after fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Helper Functions**\n",
    "* run_command_with_live_output: Runs shell commands (e.g., training) and streams logs live.\n",
    "* construct_shell_command: Makes shell commands easy to copy-paste.\n",
    "* Why important: Training takes time — these helpers keep you informed of progress without waiting until the job ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Artifacts (Outputs of Training)**\n",
    "* Converted model files (.npz) → quantized base model.\n",
    "* LoRA adapter file (adapters.npz) → trained weights from fine-tuning.\n",
    "* Logs & metrics → training/evaluation progress.\n",
    "* Why important: These are the redundant artifacts your thesis system will later deduplicate and reuse to save computation & storage."
